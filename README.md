## Implementation

This simple web application was implemented using the FastAPI framework due to its simplicity and speed of development.
The application receives data from ```https://timeapi.io/api/Time/current/zone?timeZone=Europe/Moscow```. This API makes it easy to get the time for any time zone.

You get application documentation by accessing the ```/docs``` endpoint.
